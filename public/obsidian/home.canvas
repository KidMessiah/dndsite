		{"type":"text","text":"## Variant Flanking \n\nIn this variant rule, flanking provides bonuses to melee attack rolls depending on the positioning of allies. Here's how it works:\n\n1.  If you have an ally on the opposite side of a creature, you gain a +2 bonus to melee attack rolls.\n2.  For each additional ally on any other side of the creature, you gain an additional +1 bonus to melee attack rolls.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to these bonuses:\n\n-   Creatures with blindsight, tremorsense, or truesight are immune to flanking, as their heightened senses prevent them from being caught off guard.\n-   If an enemy also has an ally flanking you while you're attempting to flank them, you lose your flanking bonus.\n\n_Example 1:_\n\nIn this scenario, Tim is attempting to attack a Cave Drake, and Jerry is positioned on the opposite side of the Cave Drake, providing a flanking bonus for Tim. As a result, Tim gains a +2 bonus to his melee attack rolls.\n\n![Clarence Claus ](002_Combat_000.png)\n\n***Example 2***\n\nIn this example, the Cave Drake is being flanked by Jerry, Clarence, and Claus. Jerry is on the opposite side of the Cave Drake, granting Tim a +2 bonus to his melee attack rolls. Additionally, Clarence and Claus each provide a +1 bonus. As a result, Tim's total flanking bonus is +4 to his melee attack rolls.\n\n![Claus Clarence ](002_Combat_001.png)\n\n***Example 3***\nIn this example, Jerry and Claus are attempting to assist Tim, but they are positioned on the same side of the Cave Drake. As a result, they provide only one instance of flanking between them. Tim receives a +2 bonus from Jerry and Claus due to their combined flanking, and an additional +1 from Clarence. This brings Tim's total flanking bonus to +3 for his melee attack rolls.\n\n![im Je Claus Clarence ](002_Combat_002.png)\n\n***Example 4***\nIn this final example, our heroes find themselves in the same position as in the previous example. However, the Cave Drake now has an ally. In this situation, Tim receives no bonus to his attack, as the Cave Drake's companion can alert it to the impending attacks from Claus, Jerry, or Clarence, effectively negating their element of surprise.\n\n![Jerry im Clarence ](002_Combat_003.png)\n","id":"7780e5ea27a7eb4a","x":-2280,"y":-400,"width":560,"height":3260,"color":"4"},
		{"type":"text","text":"## Doubling up on Spells \n  \nWith this variant rule, you gain increased versatility when casting spells on your turn. Rather than being restricted to casting one spell and one cantrip per turn, you can now cast any combination of spells, provided you have the necessary actions to do so.\n\nFor instance, you could cast _Power Word Kill_ targeting an opponent and then use _Healing Word_ to help an ally in the same turn.","id":"914ddb59e22b7851","x":-2860,"y":-400,"width":560,"height":320,"color":"1"},
		{"type":"text","text":"## Alternative Resurrection (Mercer Rules, a little tougher) \n\nIf a character is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by a spell or spell effect, a Resurrection Challenge is initiated. Up to 3 members of the adventuring party can offer to contribute to the ritual via a Contribution Skill Check. The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be.\n\nFor example, praying to the god of the devout, fallen character may require an Intelligence (Religion) check at an easy to medium difficulty, where loudly demanding the soul of the fallen to return from the aether may require a Charisma (Intimidation) check at a very hard or nearly impossible difficulty. Advantage and disadvantage can apply here based on how perfect, or off base, the contribution offered is.\n\nAfter all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final Resurrection success check with no modifier. The base DC for the final resurrection check is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone (signifying the slow erosion of the soul's connection to this world). For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by 2, whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by 1.\n\nAssuming a resurrection fails, you are unable to use a spell of the same or lower level than the one you attempted last. For instance, if you attempt to use *revivify* a 3rd level spell, you must then attempt the resurrection using either *raise dead* or *reincarnate* which are both 5th level spells. But if you use either of those, you must then escalate to *resurrection* (a 7th level spell), and  then *true resurrection* (a 9th level spell).","id":"2b772714114f9fa2","x":-1700,"y":-400,"width":560,"height":1020,"color":"2"},

If the description is deemed impressive, the player may be awarded a D6 Inspiration die or a Luck point as a reward.","id":"ccb025e5e052c15b","x":-3440,"y":-20,"width":560,"height":380,"color":"4"},

		{"type":"text","text":"## Signature Spells\nWhen your character gains access to a new tier of spells (e.g., a wizard obtaining 4th-level spell slots at 7th level), all spellcasting classes can choose a _Signature Spell_ to showcase the culmination of their character's growth. This spell can be from any sourcebook approved by the Dungeon Master, and it is recommended that the DM allows a selection of books beyond the core rulebooks for players to choose from.\n\nWhen selecting a _Signature Spell_, consult with your DM to ensure the spell is balanced and appropriate for the campaign. If needed, you can work together to modify the spell to fit your character's concept and maintain balance within the game.\n\nThe chosen _Signature Spell_ is always prepared and does not count against the maximum number of spells known or prepared, as applicable to your character's class.\n\nFor example, a necromancer who enjoys raising undead and using explosives reaches 9th level. They might choose a spell like Skull Bomb (from Book of Lost Spells by Frog God Games) as their _Signature Spell_ to reflect their unique expertise.","id":"69ac56e43e294bf3","x":-1120,"y":220,"width":560,"height":680,"color":"1"},
